To test the hypothesis regarding suitable cooking temperature and duration of the popular Indian
flat bread, most commonly known as ‘Chapati’ or ‘roti’ and whether overcooking them will lead to

or the supermarket. Do the macro and micro nutrients change their chemical structure over time and
degrade into something else or does nothing major happen?
